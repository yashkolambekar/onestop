        <p>We will be covering many important websites in this section, make sure you read the description provided with
            each site</p>

        <div class='website-div'>
            <a href="https://w3schools.com" target="_blank">
                <h2>W3Schools</h2>
                <img src="media/w3schools.png" alt="">
                <p>Whenever you search for a term regarding the 3 languages we use, the first side that pops up is this,
                    maybe the SEO is well optimised or is this the ultimate reference book?<br>
                    It's true to an extent, this site consists of everything you need to know about development, though
                    I don't suggest this site to learn web development but you can have a look, once in a while to keep
                    refreshing your knowledge, also you will come to this site very often through google search</p>
            </a>

        <div class='website-div'>
            <a href="https://freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">
                <h2>freeCodeCamp</h2>
                <img src="media/fcc.png" alt="">
                <p>The first site that I felt like has a well structured curicullum and this one is a bit different from
                    the w3schools this site doesn't cover everything about a language but it gives a sense of how to use
                    it in real life<br>
                    I suggest using this site to learn web development in a structural and a progressing pattern but as
                    soon as you get to know about a new term, learn it using w3schools, it will get lengthy but it will
                    be worth it</p>

                <h2>Dev Community</h2>
                <img src="media/devto.png" alt="">
                <p>This is the website you were looking for, a place where people can share their creations, information
                    and many other useful stuff and a plus point - It's only for developers<br>
                    From podcasts to tutorials and guidance, everything at one place and you can also chat to folks but
                    you need to follow each other and that's not an hard thing. I feel this is a <b>Facebook for
                        Developers</b></p>

                <p>Reddit can be the best platform to connect to people of same intrests and be a part of a community of
                    smart people
                    <br>Also make sure you don't share much of your personal information here, it's managed by the

                <img src="media/codepen.png" alt="">
                <p>To give a short explanation, people share their creations here, you can get inspiration from these
                    projects and also when you have to host small pieces of code to share or test this can be a good
                    friend to your help</p>
