Hey Shruti, firstly I want to thank you for giving everyone this opportunity to learn and showcase their skills and talent, and also not to mention the community itself which is going to be there with most of us ahead in this journey of achieving excellence

And a short review of the course, it was very beginner friendly and well structured, but I was unable to complete it because of some unintelligible problems from my side but it's just like I was not able to keep up with it on time but I will for sure complete it whenever possible
 
 So therefore I made this site only in HTML, CSS and JavaScript because these are the only languages I am comfortable with now and maybe the only that I know, Apart from that fontawesome cdn for fonts and nothing more is used here
 
 As I told you earlier I tried to make it to help developers in their life, I am not sure how much justice does this site serves to the initial idea



So I'll start explaining it now

Very first, <a href="https://github.com/yashkolambekar/onestop/blob/main/media/logo.png" target="_top">The Favicon</a> of this site is designed by me
